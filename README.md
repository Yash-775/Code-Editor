Code Editor

It is as its name suggest, a coding editor made with HTML, Css and Javascript.

Fun part is we can write HTML, Css and JavaScript code in editor and can see the live evaluated result on output screen.
I made it as the one of the first front-end projects.

Later I also added a copy feature, so that after writting the code user can copy that code simply by pressing copy button.
Copy button is provided on the top of each code writting section.

It can be further improved by Adding Account creating feature that will help in saving the project in code editor only.
But it will require Database integration and it will become a full-stack project at the end.

## 🚀 Features

- Write HTML, Css and JavaScript Code
